This is my branch of canonical p9p repo. I try to keep all
updates from original to be synced.

Diffs

-Acme Mail threaded by conversation.

-On darvin gestures implement mouse chords.

-Acme has command Rev as opposite of Look. Executing Look after Rev effectively select text between two marks.

-Command Edit without args after all selections place tik in last insert position.

-Tik incorrect positioning after executing Load fixed

-Few cosmetic changes due to my own tastes


This is a port of many Plan 9 libraries and programs to Unix.

Installation
------------

To install, run ./INSTALL.  It builds mk and then uses mk to
run the rest of the installation.  

For more details, see install(1), at install.txt in this directory
and at https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/man1/install.html.

Documentation
-------------

See https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/man/ for more documentation.
(Documentation is also in this tree, but you need to run
a successful install first.  After that, "9 man 1 intro".)

Intro(1) contains a list of man pages that describe new features
or differences from Plan 9.

Helping out
-----------

If you'd like to help out, great!  The TODO file contains a small list.

If you port this code to other architectures, please share your changes
so others can benefit.

Git
---

You can use Git to keep your local copy up-to-date as we make 
changes and fix bugs.  See the git(1) man page here ("9 man git")
for details on using Git.
