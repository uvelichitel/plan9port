DEVDRAW

  Devdrawserver is a client-server devdraw[1]. It allows for later
  attachment, so it can easily be run on a remote machine, proxying the
  draw calls to a local devdraw.
  
  On a remote machine:
  
  	remote% DEVDRAW=devdrawserver acme
  
  and locally:
  
  	% dialdevdraw 'ssh remote dial -e unix!/tmp/devdrawserver'
  	
  This is still work in progress, but it's fully functional.

BUGS

  Wouldn't be needed at all if devdraw was a real file server.
